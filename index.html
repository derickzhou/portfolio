					<p class="font-bold text-gray-500 text-3xl">My Journey in Information Systems at De La Salle College of Saint Benilde</p>
					<p class="text-xl">I am grateful for my four years at De La Salle College of Saint Benilde, where I pursued a degree in Information Systems. The dynamic and innovative courses provided by the school not only imparted essential business knowledge but also equipped me with valuable technical skills. In software development, I learned to design and utilize databases, developing Microsoft desktop applications using the C# programming language and android mobile applications using the Kotlin programming language. Proficiency in web development was achieved through programming languages like C#, Java, PHP, and frameworks such as ASP.NET Core and Laravel. Additionally, I created machine learning models with the Python programming language.</p>
					<p class="text-xl">Venturing into hardware projects, I successfully developed a Wi-Fi MP3 music player and a small weather station using Arduino to measure temperature, humidity, and air pressure. Our group also proposed a blockchain-based voting system to UnionBank of the Philippines.</p>
					<p class="text-xl">I extend my sincere appreciation to the school for providing an enriching environment that fostered my growth in a wide array of technical disciplines. These four years have not only expanded my skill set but have also instilled in me a passion for innovation and problem-solving.</p>
					<p class="text-xl">Reflecting on my personal journey, these four years have not only been a period of academic growth but also a time of personal development. I have cultivated a strong commitment to excellence and a passion for overcoming challenges. Moving forward, I am eager to apply the knowledge and skills gained at De La Salle College of Saint Benilde in real-world scenarios. My commitment extends to making meaningful contributions to the tech industry, embracing innovation, and addressing societal challenges through technology. As I embark on the next steps of my professional journey, I am confident that the foundation laid during my university years will guide me towards continued success and fulfillment in the ever-evolving landscape of Information Systems.</p>

					<p class="font-bold text-gray-500 text-3xl">VLOO: The Efficiency of an Order-to-Delivery (OTD) Application for Specialty Stores in Makati City</p>
					<p class="text-xl">VLOO is an intuitive and secure Order-to-Delivery (OTD) application that allows specialty stores in Makati City, especially laundry stations, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stores, and gas stations, to subscribe to VLOO monthly in order to sell their products and services to online and walk in customers. This improves the efficiency, note the bottlenecks, and streamline the OTD process of specialty stores in Makati City to bring a better customer experience, encouraging more specialty stores and customers in the Philippines to adopt an OTD application.</p>

					<p class="font-bold text-gray-500 text-3xl">Wi-Fi MP3 Music Player with ESP32 NodeMCU Development Board</p>
					<p class="text-xl">This project aims to develop a multifunctional and user-friendly Wi-Fi MP3 music player. By integrating the ESP32 NodeMCU Development Board, Micro SD Card Adapter, MAX98357A Digital to Analog Converter, and Audio Jack Speaker, this device becomes an independent music player capable of providing high-quality audio.</p>
					<p class="text-xl">The addition of a web interface enhances user interaction, allowing multiple users to simultaneously connect to the ESP32 Wi-Fi network and access a range of features. Unlike Bluetooth speakers, which typically only allow one user to connect at a time, this Wi-Fi MP3 music player provides an excellent collaborative experience. In addition, the Wi-Fi range exceeds the limits of Bluetooth, allowing users to control playback and manage their music collections from further distances.</p>

					<p class="font-bold text-gray-500 text-3xl">Designblue Philippines Inc.</p>
					<p class="text-xl">Designblue Philippines Inc. specializes in assisting businesses in promoting their brand through the creation of custom websites tailored to each client's needs. The company also addresses existing business challenges by developing innovative website solutions. The team is well-organized, with some members managing overall design and site mapping, others handling backend and frontend coding, and others focusing on testing and quality assurance.</p>
					<p class="text-xl">I am grateful to Designblue for affording me the opportunity to intern as a quality assurance specialist. Throughout this internship, my primary responsibilities have revolved around assisting the QA team in identifying bugs within websites developed by our talented team of developers, replicating issues flagged by either the team or clients, verifying the resolution of existing issues, uploading content to the CMS, creating CMS manuals, and aiding developers in organizing code structures.</p>
					<p class="text-xl">This internship has provided invaluable insights into bridging the gap between my existing skills and the demands of the real-world professional environment, inspiring me to further study and refine my abilities.</p>
					<p class="text-xl">The following are the client websites that I have been involved with during my time as a quality assurance (QA) intern.</p>
